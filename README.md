# PyDigits_RealTimeHandWriteRecog
A real-time handwritten digits recognition by PyTorch &amp; PySide6.

使用PyTorch和Qt实现手写数字的实时识别。

(Here will be placed a GIF of this project.)

# Abstract
* Handwrite input and real-time indetification are reliazed.
* GUI is designed based on PySide6.
* Construct a neural network. Specifically, it's a model with three convolution layers and fully connected layers, which built by PyTorch deep learning framework.

# Environment Requirement
This is my environment:
* Windows 10
* Python 3.10
* PyTorch 2.1.0, Torchvision xx.xx
* PySide xx.xx
* CUDA 12.0

# Installation
`git clone https://github.com/CatPieee/PyDigits_RealTimeHandWriteRecog.git`

`cd PyDigits_RealTimeHandWriteRecog`

`python train.py`

`python main.py`
